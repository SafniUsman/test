Introduction
Facial keypoint detection plays a crucial role in computer vision and image analysis, offering valuable insights into facial features and expressions. The significance of facial keypoint detection lies in its ability to extract precise information about the location and orientation of specific facial landmarks. This information is then utilized in various applications, with a notable impact on emotion analysis and facial expression detection.
In essence, facial keypoint detection serves as a fundamental building block for advanced applications in computer vision, particularly those related to human emotion and facial expression analysis. By accurately capturing and analyzing facial landmarks, this technology enhances the capabilities of systems designed for human-computer interaction, social robotics, and various other domains where understanding and responding to human expressions are essential.
Problem Definition:
In this project, the machine learning problem revolves around facial keypoint detection. The primary task is to accurately localize 15 key facial landmarks on grayscale images. The dataset contains both the facial images and the corresponding (x, y) coordinates for these keypoints. The machine learning model's goal is to learn a mapping between the input images and their associated facial keypoints.
Task:
•	Facial Keypoint Detection: Given a grayscale facial image, the model needs to predict the (x, y) coordinates of 15 specific facial keypoints, including the corners of the eyes, nose, and mouth, eyebrows etc.

Objective
The goal of this project is to train a facial keypoint detection model using deep learning techniques. The project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to develop a robust and accurate model capable of localizing facial keypoints on images. These facial keypoints represent critical landmarks on the face, such as the eyes, nose, eyebrows and mouth.
The primary objective is to create a model that can effectively analyze facial features, providing precise information about the location and orientation of key facial landmarks. Through the use of deep learning architectures, specifically Residual Convolutional Neural Networks, the project intends to enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect facial keypoints across various images.
Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this facial keypoint detection project is stored in a CSV file named "KeyFacialPoints.csv." The dataset has a RangeIndex with a total of 2140 entries, ranging from 0 to 2139. It contains a total of 31 columns.
Key Attributes:
1.	Size: The dataset comprises 2140 entries, indicating that there are 2140 data samples.
2.	Facial Keypoints: The dataset includes information about facial keypoints, and these keypoints are labeled across the columns. The total number of facial keypoints is 15.
Preliminary Data Processing:
Before training a facial keypoint detection model, some preliminary data processing steps are applied to prepare the dataset for use. The steps include:
•	The values for the image are provided as space-separated strings in the CSV file.
•	The values in each row are separated using a space (' ') as the separator. This separation is crucial for extracting individual pixel values.
•	The separated values are converted into a numpy array using np.fromstring. This function is employed to transform the space-separated string into a 1D numpy array.
•	The obtained 1D array is reshaped into a 2D array of shape (96, 96). This reshaping is essential as it aligns with the expected format of an image with a resolution of 96x96 pixels.
