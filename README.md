# Facial Keypoint Detection Project

## Introduction

Facial keypoint detection plays a crucial role in computer vision and image analysis, offering valuable insights into facial features and expressions. The significance of facial keypoint detection lies in its ability to extract precise information about the location and orientation of specific facial landmarks. This information is then utilized in various applications, with a notable impact on emotion analysis and facial expression detection.
In essence, facial keypoint detection serves as a fundamental building block for advanced applications in computer vision, particularly those related to human emotion and facial expression analysis. By accurately capturing and analyzing facial landmarks, this technology enhances the capabilities of systems designed for human-computer interaction, social robotics, and various other domains where understanding and responding to human expressions are essential.


## Problem Definition

In this project, the machine learning problem revolves around facial keypoint detection. The primary task is to accurately localize 15 key facial landmarks on grayscale images. The dataset contains both the facial images and the corresponding (x, y) coordinates for these keypoints. The machine learning model's goal is to learn a mapping between the input images and their associated facial keypoints.
### Task:
â€¢	Facial Keypoint Detection: Given a grayscale facial image, the model needs to predict the (x, y) coordinates of 15 specific facial keypoints, including the corners of the eyes, nose, and mouth, eyebrows etc.


## Objective

The goal of this project is to train a facial keypoint detection model using deep learning techniques. The project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to develop a robust and accurate model capable of localizing facial keypoints on images. These facial keypoints represent critical landmarks on the face, such as the eyes, nose, eyebrows and mouth.
The primary objective is to create a model that can effectively analyze facial features, providing precise information about the location and orientation of key facial landmarks. Through the use of deep learning architectures, specifically Residual Convolutional Neural Networks, the project intends to enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect facial keypoints across various images.


## Dataset Overview

The dataset, stored in "KeyFacialPoints.csv," comprises 2140 entries with 31 columns. It includes information about 15 facial keypoints, and preliminary data processing is applied to convert space-separated strings into 2D arrays of shape (96, 96).

## Preliminary Data Processing

Before training the model, preliminary data processing includes converting image values from space-separated strings to 2D arrays of shape (96, 96).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed using visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Grayscale images with annotated facial keypoints are plotted, providing a valuable understanding of the distribution and positioning of facial landmarks.

## Methodology

In this project, a deep learning approach is adopted, utilizing CNNs with a focus on Residual Blocks. Data processing involves augmentation techniques and image normalization. The model architecture, inspired by ResNet, includes Convolutional Layers, Residual Blocks, Pooling Layers, and Fully Connected Layers.

## Data Processing

- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like flipping and brightness increase are applied for training.
- **Image Normalization:** Images are normalized to ensure consistent input values.

## Model Architecture

1. **Input Layer:** Grayscale facial images of size (96, 96).
2. **Convolutional Layers:** Extract hierarchical features.
3. **Residual Blocks:** Address vanishing gradient issues.
4. **Pooling Layers:** Downsample spatial dimensions.
5. **Fully Connected Layers:** Map features to 30 output coordinates (15 keypoints).

## Training Process

The model is trained using backpropagation and Adam optimization, minimizing the difference between predicted and true facial keypoints.

## Results

Insightful results are obtained:
- **Accuracy:** Approximately 73.52% on the test set.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 6.72, indicating average difference between predicted and true keypoints.

## Conclusion

The model's accurate detection of facial keypoints opens avenues for integration with emotion recognition classifiers. Understanding both spatial characteristics and emotional context enhances the broader goal of facial expression analysis.
